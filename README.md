## üìã Assignment Overview

### üí° Theory Questions

- What is Python and why is it popular?
- What is an interpreter in Python?
- What are pre-defined keywords in Python?
- Can keywords be used as variable names?
- What is mutability in Python?
- Why are lists mutable but tuples are immutable?
- What is the difference between `==` and `is` operators?
- What are logical operators in Python?
- What is type casting in Python?
- Difference between implicit and explicit type casting.
- Purpose of conditional statements.
- How does `elif` work?
- `for` vs `while` loops.
- Scenario where `while` loop is more suitable.
